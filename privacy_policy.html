<h3>Storage Duration</h3>
<p>Unless a more specific storage duration is stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you submit a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons no longer apply.</p>

<h3>General Information on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on This Website</h3>
<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data under Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR.

<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
<p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if it is required as part of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in sharing data under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits data sharing. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid processing agreement. In cases of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>

<h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out prior to the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
<p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING, OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>

The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically provided to you or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

<h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
<p>Within the framework of applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data.

<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time to exercise this right. The right to restrict processing applies in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
  <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If we no longer need your personal data but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from being stored – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of significant public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>

<h2>6. Newsletter</h2>

<h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
<p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary basis. We use these data solely for sending the requested information and do not pass them on to third parties.</p>
<p>The processing of the data entered in the newsletter subscription form is based solely on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You can revoke your consent to the storage of data, the email address, and its use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g., via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing that has already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<p>The data you provide for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after unsubscribing or once the purpose is no longer relevant. We reserve the right to delete or block email addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>Data stored for other purposes at our company remains unaffected by this.</p>
<p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a blacklist by us or the newsletter service provider if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and is not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements for sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is not time-limited. <strong>You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>
