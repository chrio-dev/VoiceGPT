<h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Information</h2>

<h3>Data Protection</h3>
<p>The operators of this site take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We handle your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.</p>
<p>When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this is done.</p>
<p>We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., in communication by email) may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.</p>

<h3>Information on the Responsible Party</h3>
<p>The responsible party for data processing on this website is:</p>
<p>Chrio GmbH</p>
<p>Phone: +49 89 26204274<br>
Email: info@chrio.dev</p>
<p>The responsible party is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).</p>

<h3>Storage Duration</h3>
<p>Unless a more specific storage duration is stated within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you submit a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter case, deletion will occur after these reasons no longer apply.</p>

<h3>General Information on the Legal Bases of Data Processing on This Website</h3>
<p>If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data based on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR or Art. 9(2)(a) GDPR if special categories of data under Art. 9(1) GDPR are processed. In the case of express consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, data processing is also based on Art. 49(1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or access to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), data processing is additionally based on § 25(1) TDDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for contract fulfillment or pre-contractual measures, we process your data based on Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Data processing may also be based on our legitimate interest under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the applicable legal bases in each case is provided in the following sections of this privacy policy.</p>

<h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>
<p>In the course of our business activities, we work with various external parties. In some cases, it is also necessary to transfer personal data to these external parties. We only pass on personal data to external parties if it is required as part of contract fulfillment, if we are legally obligated to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have a legitimate interest in sharing data under Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, or if another legal basis permits data sharing. When using processors, we only transfer personal data of our customers on the basis of a valid processing agreement. In cases of joint processing, a joint processing agreement is concluded.</p>

<h3>Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>
<p>Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit consent. You can revoke consent that you have already given at any time. The legality of data processing carried out prior to the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>

<h3>Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)</h3>
<p>IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6(1)(E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA AT ANY TIME FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OUTWEIGH YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSERTING, EXERCISING, OR DEFENDING LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(1) GDPR).</p>
<p>IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE EXTENT THAT IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21(2) GDPR).</p>

<h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>
<p>In the event of violations of the GDPR, affected individuals have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, place of work, or the location of the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedies.</p>

<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>You have the right to have data that we process on the basis of your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically provided to you or to a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent technically feasible.</p>

<h3>Information, Correction, and Deletion</h3>
<p>Within the framework of applicable legal provisions, you have the right to free information at any time about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of the data processing and, if applicable, a right to correction or deletion of this data. You can contact us at any time if you have further questions on the topic of personal data.</p>

<h3>Right to Restrict Processing</h3>
<p>You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time to exercise this right. The right to restrict processing applies in the following cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the review, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
  <li>If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If we no longer need your personal data but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.</li>
  <li>If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balance must be struck between your and our interests. As long as it has not yet been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data – apart from being stored – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of significant public interest of the European Union or a member state.</p>

<h3>SSL or TLS Encryption</h3>
<p>This site uses SSL or TLS encryption for security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries that you send to us as the site operator. You can recognize an encrypted connection by the fact that the address line of the browser changes from "http://" to "https://" and by the lock symbol in your browser line.</p>
<p>If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.</p>

<h3>Objection to Advertising Emails</h3>
<p>The use of contact data published as part of the legal notice obligation for sending unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby objected to. The operators of the sites expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.</p>

<h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>

<h3>Cookies</h3>
<p>Our websites use so-called "cookies." Cookies are small data packages and do not cause any harm to your device. They are either temporarily stored for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted after your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or they are automatically deleted by your web browser.</p>
<p>Cookies can be set by us (first-party cookies) or by third-party companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the integration of specific services provided by third-party companies within websites (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).</p>
<p>Cookies serve various functions. Numerous cookies are technically necessary because certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the shopping cart function or displaying videos). Other cookies may be used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>Cookies required for the electronic communication process, to provide specific functions requested by you (e.g., for the shopping cart function), or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies for measuring web audience) are stored based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent for the storage of cookies and similar recognition technologies was requested, processing is based solely on this consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TDDG); consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and only allow cookies in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for certain cases or generally, and activate automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be restricted.</p>
<p>Details about which cookies and services are used on this website can be found in this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>5. Social Media</h2>

<h3>X (formerly Twitter)</h3>
<p>Functions of the X (formerly Twitter) service are integrated on this website. These functions are provided by the parent company X Corp., 1355 Market Street, Suite 900, San Francisco, CA 94103, USA. For data processing for people outside the USA, Twitter International Unlimited Company, One Cumberland Place, Fenian Street, Dublin 2, D02 AX07, Ireland, is responsible.</p>
<p>If the social media element is active, a direct connection is established between your device and the X server. X (formerly Twitter) receives information that you have visited this website. By using X (formerly Twitter) and the "Re-Tweet" or "Repost" function, the websites you visit are linked to your X (formerly Twitter) account and made known to other users. We point out that, as the provider of the pages, we have no knowledge of the content of the transmitted data or its use by X (formerly Twitter). For more information, see the X (formerly Twitter) privacy policy at: <a href="https://x.com/de/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/de/privacy</a>.</p>
<p>The use of this service is based on your consent under Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TDDG. Consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>Data transfer to the USA is based on the EU Commission's standard contractual clauses. Details can be found here: <a href="https://gdpr.x.com/en/controller-to-controller-transfers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://gdpr.x.com/en/controller-to-controller-transfers.html</a>.</p>
<p>You can adjust your privacy settings for X (formerly Twitter) in the account settings at <a href="https://x.com/settings/account" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://x.com/settings/account</a>.</p>
<p>The company is certified under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF). The DPF is an agreement between the European Union and the USA to ensure compliance with European data protection standards in the USA. Each company certified under the DPF agrees to uphold these data protection standards.

<h2>6. Newsletter</h2>

<h3>Newsletter Data</h3>
<p>If you would like to receive the newsletter offered on the website, we require an email address from you as well as information that allows us to verify that you are the owner of the specified email address and agree to receive the newsletter. Further data is not collected or only on a voluntary basis. We use these data solely for sending the requested information and do not pass them on to third parties.</p>
<p>The processing of the data entered in the newsletter subscription form is based solely on your consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR). You can revoke your consent to the storage of data, the email address, and its use for sending the newsletter at any time, e.g., via the "unsubscribe" link in the newsletter. The legality of the data processing that has already taken place remains unaffected by the revocation.</p>
<p>The data you provide for the purpose of receiving the newsletter will be stored by us or the newsletter service provider until you unsubscribe from the newsletter and deleted from the newsletter distribution list after unsubscribing or once the purpose is no longer relevant. We reserve the right to delete or block email addresses from our newsletter distribution list at our own discretion within the scope of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR.</p>
<p>Data stored for other purposes at our company remains unaffected by this.</p>
<p>After you unsubscribe from the newsletter distribution list, your email address may be stored in a blacklist by us or the newsletter service provider if this is necessary to prevent future mailings. The data from the blacklist is used only for this purpose and is not merged with other data. This serves both your interest and our interest in complying with the legal requirements for sending newsletters (legitimate interest within the meaning of Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR). The storage in the blacklist is not time-limited. <strong>You can object to the storage if your interests outweigh our legitimate interest.</strong></p>

<h2>7. Plugins and Tools</h2>

<h3>Google reCAPTCHA</h3>
<p>We use "Google reCAPTCHA" (hereafter "reCAPTCHA") on this website. The provider is Google Ireland Limited ("Google"), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.</p>
<p>reCAPTCHA is used to check whether data entry on this website (e.g., in a contact form) is done by a human or by an automated program. To do this, reCAPTCHA analyzes the behavior of the website visitor based on various characteristics. This analysis starts automatically as soon as the website visitor enters the website. For analysis, reCAPTCHA evaluates various information (e.g., IP address, time spent on the website, or user mouse movements). The data collected during the analysis is forwarded to Google.</p>
<p>reCAPTCHA analyses take place entirely in the background. Website visitors are not informed that an analysis is taking place.</p>
<p>The data storage and analysis are based on Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in protecting its web offerings from abusive automated spying and spam. If appropriate consent was requested, processing is based solely on Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25(1) TDDG, provided the consent covers the storage of cookies or access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the meaning of the TDDG. The consent can be revoked at any time.</p>
<p>For more information about Google reCAPTCHA, please refer to Google's privacy policy and terms of use at the following links: <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a> and <a href="https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en</a>.</p>
<p>The company is certified under the "EU-US Data Privacy Framework" (DPF).
